Welcome to the Unimock library!

Please note that this library demands C++14 or later.

To just install the library you type the following.

If you want to run the unit tests, we recommend to create a build directory
first. Run the unit tests with the following commands.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make test
